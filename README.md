# IP Overlap

IP Overlap CLI  prints to STDOUT the relation between
two CIDRs.
<br/>The relations can be:
<br/>• subset: if the network of the second address is included in the first one
<br/>• superset: if the network of the second address includes the first one
<br/>• different: if the two networks are not overlapping
<br/>• same: if both address are in the same network
<br/>The program is only intended to work with IPv4 addresses.
